# Response to "Tractor uses local ancestry to enable the inclusion of admixed individuals in GWAS and to boost power"

See [simulation study](
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bogdanlab/tractor-response/blob/main/simulation/results.ipynb) for
1. main figure.
2. qq plot and false positive ratio in the null simulation.
3. extended results of power.
4. association testing when the causal SNP is not typed

See [real data study](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bogdanlab/tractor-response/blob/main/ukb/04_assoc.ipynb) for Manhattan plots of known risk reigons for lipids traits.

See directory [simulation](simulation), [ukb](ukb) for details of simulation and real data analysis.
